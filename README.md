# Enginuity 🚀

**Enginuity** is a student-focused web application designed to help engineering students reflect on their weekly learning, understand their strengths, and receive a personalized learning roadmap — before it’s too late.

Most students realize the importance of skills, exams, and career direction only during placements. Enginuity solves this by enabling **weekly reflection + AI-driven analysis** to guide students consistently.


## 🧠 Problem Statement
Engineering students often follow a herd mentality — focusing only on college lectures without understanding:
- What subjects they truly enjoy
- Where their strengths lie
- Which opportunities (GATE, placements, higher studies, skills) suit them best  

This leads to panic and poor decisions in later years.


## 💡 Solution
Enginuity allows students to:
- Submit a **weekly learning reflection** (takes < 5 minutes)
- Get an **AI-style analysis** of their learning mode and strengths
- Receive a **personalized weekly roadmap**
- Track progress through a **shareable progress card**

The platform is designed to motivate without overwhelming the student.


## ✨ Key Features
- Weekly reflection form (subject-wise)
- Learning mode & core strength analysis
- Personalized weekly focus & roadmap
- Downloadable progress card
- Clean, modern dashboard UI
- Fully deployed MVP
  

## 🤖 Where AI Comes In
Enginuity uses rule-based intelligence inspired by AI systems:
- Analyzes weekly inputs to detect learning patterns
- Classifies students based on logic vs memorization preference
- Generates adaptive recommendations and roadmaps

This MVP demonstrates how AI can guide students through **personalized learning paths**.
